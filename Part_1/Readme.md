## Conclusion

Key concepts learned:

- Using `gsap.to()` and `gsap.from()` for basic animations.
- Chaining animations with `gsap.timeline()`.
- Controlling animation timing with `duration` and `delay`.
- Creating looping animations with `yoyo` and `repeat`.

GSAP makes it easy to build complex and smooth animations with minimal code!
